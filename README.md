- 👋 Hi, I’m @HalcyoneBird
- 👀 I’m a charetered accountant. I have started my own practise Halcyone Finance. I want to be known as the accountant for the people. I'm trying to build a practice that supports freedom, ultimately. I want to use software and tools developed by the people for the people, open source. This community makes me optimistic about the future and I'm looking forward to learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. Paying focus to software and tools that will help me manage my workload and my clients. I'm delving deeper into crypto and I want to position myself as a leader in UK crypto accounting so I can save people as much tax as possible! That's my goal. Help people keep as much money as possible from the tax man.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure yet! I'm currently building a website using WordPress. www.halcyonefinance.org
